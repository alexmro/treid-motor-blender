# Motor (Blender Addon)

A Blender addon that aims to make Blender scenes interactive and exportable as native 3D applications for many platforms

This addon is part of a larger project I have in mind, but is an essential component of it. I decided that is best to 
push new updates every weekly, so be sure to check for them regularly, if this addon caught your interest.

## Installing and using the addon

You can download the addon and install it the usual way (go to _Edit > Preferences > Addons_, click _Install_ and pick
the ZIP folder you just downloaded from the [Releases](https://github.com/alexmro/treid-motor-blender/releases) page.

Once installed, you will see the little _Run_ gizmo in the bottom right corner of the 3D view. You can press it to 
run the scene (or you can press the _P_ key). Press _ESC_ to get out of the interactive mode.

A new editor is also available, the _Logic Node Editor_, where you can create the logic behind the interactive scenes.
At the moment there's only one node that for the scene starting event and another one for writing stuff on the console.
This is just the bare-bones of what's coming.
