# Motor (Blender Addon)

A Blender addon that aims to make Blender scenes interactive and exportable as native 3D applications for many platforms

This addon is part of a larger project I have in mind, but is an essential component of it.

## Installing and using the addon

You can download the addon and install it the usual way (go to _Edit > Preferences > Addons_, click _Install_ and pick
the ZIP folder you just downloaded from the [Releases](https://github.com/alexmro/treid-motor-blender/releases) page.

Once installed, you will see the little _Run_ gizmo in the bottom right corner of the 3D view. You can press it to 
run the scene (or you can press the _P_ key). Press _ESC_ to get out of the interactive mode.

A new editor is also available, the _Logic Node Editor_, where you can create the logic behind the interactive scenes.
